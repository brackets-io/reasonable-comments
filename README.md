Reasonable Comments for Brackets
================================
Simple enhancement for typing block comments in Brackets: when you press Enter, the next line is automatically prefixed with a properly indented "`*`". So for example, instead of this:

```
    /**
|
     */
```

You'll get this:

```
    /**
     * |
     */
```
